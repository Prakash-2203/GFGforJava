First n Fibonacci
Difficulty: BasicAccuracy: 29.92%Submissions: 236K+Points: 1
Given a number N, find the first N Fibonacci numbers. The first two number of the series are 1 and 1.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
Output: 1 1 2 3 5
Example 2:

Input:
N = 7
Output: 1 1 2 3 5 8 13
Your Task:
Your task is to complete printFibb() which takes single argument N and returns a list of first N Fibonacci numbers.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).
Note: This space is used to store and return the answer for printing purpose.

Constraints:
1<= N <=84

Code:


class Solution
{
    //Function to return list containing first n fibonacci numbers.
    public static long[] printFibb(int n) 
    {
      long[] fib = new long[n];
      
      if(n>=1) fib[0] = 1;
      if(n>=2) fib[1] = 1;
      for(int i = 2;i<n;i++){
          fib[i] = fib[i-2]+fib[i-1];
      }
      return fib;
    }
}
